In this crash course, you'll learn how to build and run your first Android app in the  Kotlin programming language. Since Android took the world by storm, developers have had few alternatives to Java for app development. Java was the programming language that the most advanced phones were using to run their native apps on their proprietary operating systems. But Kotlin is a modern programming language solution for Android and is now one of the most loved programming languages out there. Itâ€™s poised to dominate Android app development.
