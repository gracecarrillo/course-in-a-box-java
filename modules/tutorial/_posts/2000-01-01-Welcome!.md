In this crash course, you'll learn how to build and run your first Java program, and a couple more.

JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language.  Writing, compiling and debugging a program is easy in java.  It helps to create modular programs and reusable code.

## Some Java terminology

**bytecode:** Java is a high level programming language. A program written in a high level language cannot be run on any machine directly. First, it needs to be translated into that particular machine language. The **javac** compiler does this for us. It takes a Java program (*.java* file containing the source code) and translates it into machine code (referred as byte code or a *.class* file). The machine language for a Java Virtual Machine is byte code.

**Java Virtual Machine (JVM):** Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that resides in the real machine (your computer). This makes it easier for the **javac** compiler as it has to generate **byte code** for JVM rather than different machine code for each type of machine.

Basically, this is how Java programming works: we write the program, then we compile the program and at last we run the program.

  1) Writing of the program is of course done by a java programmer like you and me.
  2) Compilation of the program is done by a java compiler. **javac** is the primary java compiler included in java development kit (JDK). It takes java program as input and generates java **bytecode** as output.
  3) Lastly, JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. This is called **program run** phase. We run the programme we wrote.

**Each operating system has a different JVM, however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is the same across all operating systems. Which means that the byte code generated on Windows can be run on Mac OS and vice versa. That is why we say Java is a platform independent language.**

## Java Runtime Environment(JRE)

When you have JRE installed on your system, you can run a Java program. You just won’t be able to compile it. When you only need to run a java program on your computer, you would only need JRE.

## Java Development Kit(JDK)

As the name suggests this is the complete Java development kit that includes the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compilers and various other tools like Java debugger etc. In order to create, compile and run Java program you would need JDK installed on your computer.

## Java is Object Oriented 

Java is an Object Oriented language. Object oriented programming is a way of organizing programs as collection of objects, each of which represents an instance of a class.

## Java is simple

Java is considered as one of simple language because it does not have complex features like Operator overloading, Multiple inheritance, pointers and Explicit memory allocation.

## Java is a Robust Language

Robust means reliable. Java programming language is developed in a way that puts a lot of emphasis on early checking for possible errors. That’s why a java compiler is able to detect errors that are not easy to detect in other programming languages. The main features of java that makes it robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling and memory allocation.

## Java is distributed

Java programs can be distributed on more than one systems that are connected to each other using internet connection. Objects on one JVM (java virtual machine) can execute procedures on a remote JVM.

## Java allows for Multithreading

Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilisation of CPU.

## Java is Portable
As discussed above, java code that is written on one machine can run on another machine. The platform independent byte code can be carried to any platform for execution that makes java code portable.


## So to summarise everything: 

The Java Virtual machine (JVM) is the virtual machine that runs on actual machine (your computer) and executes Java byte code. The JVM doesn't understand Java source code, that's why we need to have the javac compiler that compiles *.java* files to obtain *.class* files that contain the byte codes, which are the ones the JVM understands. JVM makes java portable (write once, run anywhere). Each operating system has different JVMs, however the output they produce after execution of byte code is same across all operating systems.
